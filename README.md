# Mutant Selection by Using Fourier Expansion

## Sava≈ü Takan, Tolga Ayav

Mutation analysis is a widely used technique to evaluate the effectiveness of test suites in both hardware and software testing. The original model is mutated systematically under certain fault assumptions and test cases are checked against the created mutants whether the test cases kill them or not. Mutation analysis is usually a computationally intensive task, particularly in Finite State Machine (FSM) testing due to a possibly huge amount of mutants. In mutation analysis, it is assumed that each mutant is identical in terms of its fault coverage, which is not always the case. This study proposes a mutant selection method based on Fourier analysis of Boolean functions. Fourier helps to determine the most effective transitions on the output so that the mutants related to those transitions can be selected. To evaluate the method, test cases are generated by the well-known W method that has the capability of killing all mutants.
